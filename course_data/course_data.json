Weak or narrow AI: it is a type of AI which can perform a predefined narrow set of instructions without exhibiting any thinking capability. It is the most widely used type of AI in this world. Some famous examples are Apple's Siri, Alexa, AlphaGo, IBM's Watson supercomputer, Sophia (the humanoid) all belong to the weak AI type. General AI: it is the type of AI which can perform the tasks like what human can do. Till now it is not achieved, there are no such machines which works like human or can think as perfectly as human, but it may happen in near future. Strong AI: it is the type of AI in which it is expected that the machine will surpass the capacity of human. It will perform better than humans, though it is tough, but it is not impossible. It may be the situation when it can be said that the machines will be the master and overtake humans.

In ML the system is mostly put either in supervised or unsupervised learning method with multilayers of algorithms undergoing such learning methods. As the number of layers increases, it is called as deep learning or Deep Neural Network (DNN). The initial layer is denoted as the input layer, the last layer is called the output layer and the intermediate layers are termed as the hidden layer, where all the layers are interconnected. The amount of the depth of the network in terms of layers decides how efficient the algorithm can do the dense representation of any data (for example, in an image, the edge, boundaries, etc., are the required data needed for representation). This method has the capability of working upon unstructured data and provides efficient results. This includes intake of large amount of data known as big data and assures better performance with respect to the complex data. It helps in enhanced feature extraction, pattern recognition of complex dataset and high-level data extraction.

Deep neural network in which there are multiple hidden layers between the input and output layer and it is the most widely used network. The deep neural networks are further broadly classified into three categories: Feed-forward neural networks: it is the single way data transmission type of network in which the data moves towards the output layer through the input layer. It does not contain any recurrent movement of information. Recurrent neural networks: in Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), there is a recurrent flow of data from the output to the input to generate the memory for the system, learn from the data and produce results. Some of the major applications of the RNN are the Chatbots, fraud detection algorithms in monetary transaction, providing caption for images, and many more. Convolutional neural networks: the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are the most widely used neural networks which have multi-layered neural network. The CNN is considered to be the most efficient form of neural network which is basically used for feature extraction of images and pattern recognition. It has a wider range of application in the field of medical diagnosis and has helped in medical image analysis. Deep CNN has its great usage in radiology and pathology as well. For instance, it can help in esophageal endoscopy for detecting esophageal cancer. The CNN network is widely used method and algorithm in the application of deep learning and is basically used for image identification and classification. The algorithms are developed in a manner to deal with the pixel data. The basic CNN network consists of two parts, i.e., feature extractor and classifier. The feature extractor contains the convolution and pooling layers whose purpose is to extract the minute features from the image in terms of pixel data. The convolutional layer deals with the feature extraction of the image and preserving the relevant data about the pixels. It reveals the information like edge, boundaries of a image. The pooling layers reduce the dimensionality of an image while retaining the important information. As CNN is a multilayer neuron network, the role classifier part of the network is to classify the information obtained from convolution and pooling layers. This role is played by the fully connective layer whose motive is to connect each node of a layer with other nodes. As a result, whatever image is placed in the input layer is produced in the output layer if passed through a simple image detection CNN network.",

Considering the world scenario, the agriculture sector shall be capable of producing almost 50% more food than being produced now. The implementation of AI and its technologies has significantly played its role in improving the situation of agriculture industry. Going with the phases of farming, AI is used in the analysis of soil and its monitoring, advancement in crop sowing phase, moving forward in the pest weed control methods and lastly to the crop harvesting and supply of produce to the right place and at justifiable rate. With the advent of AI, sensor technology and Internet this industry has benefitted to a large extent. In soil analysis and monitoring, AI can help us to know about the soil and seed relationship. In this regard, it tells which seed should be opted for specific type of soil. It predicts in reducing the use of harmful chemical fertilizers used to enhance the plant growth and monitors the irrigation method thereby saving water. According to a study done in Alfalfa, California, the use of Geographic Information System (GIS), in the irrigation method has helped to enhance the crop output by 35% and reduction in the amount of water used for irrigation. AI-based apps, basically with the help of sensors, pictures, and infrared rays help to determine the quality and properties of soil. Hence it helps in improving the agriculture process assuring better yield and profit for the concerned farmers. Moving to the next application is the sowing process enhancement by the use of AI sowing app. According to a study in 2016, pilot project with 175 farmers was initiated by ICRISAT (The International Crop Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics) with partnership of Microsoft in Kurnool district of Andhra Pradesh, India whose objective was to increase the level of output (about 30%) with decrease in the investment done prior to the farming. It was equipped with the alert messages provided to the farmers regarding the most suitable dates for cropping, land preparation, and usage of fertilizer using this app which works and gives required results by taking the images uploaded by the farmers from the user end. In another study, the development of machine learning technology along with integrated computer vision applications by Blue River Technologies aimed to optimize the herbicide and pest control. This technology helps to distinguish between the affected and normal parts of the plant. The see and spray project of Arkansas, USA, using this technology, got reduction in the required amount of expenses for weedicides per acre of land. In a different study done on the crop harvesting, it was found that the time taken by AI-based robots in tomato farms in Japan, is lesser than the time taken by the human.",

Considering the world scenario, the agriculture sector shall be capable of producing almost 50% more food than being produced now. The implementation of AI and its technologies has significantly played its role in improving the situation of agriculture industry. Going with the phases of farming, AI is used in the analysis of soil and its monitoring, advancement in crop sowing phase, moving forward in the pest weed control methods and lastly to the crop harvesting and supply of produce to the right place and at justifiable rate. With the advent of AI, sensor technology and Internet this industry has benefitted to a large extent. In soil analysis and monitoring, AI can help us to know about the soil and seed relationship. In this regard, it tells which seed should be opted for specific type of soil. It predicts in reducing the use of harmful chemical fertilizers used to enhance the plant growth and monitors the irrigation method thereby saving water. According to a study done in Alfalfa, California, the use of Geographic Information System (GIS), in the irrigation method has helped to enhance the crop output by 35% and reduction in the amount of water used for irrigation. AI-based apps, basically with the help of sensors, pictures, and infrared rays help to determine the quality and properties of soil. Hence it helps in improving the agriculture process assuring better yield and profit for the concerned farmers. Moving to the next application is the sowing process enhancement by the use of AI sowing app. According to a study in 2016, pilot project with 175 farmers was initiated by ICRISAT (The International Crop Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics) with partnership of Microsoft in Kurnool district of Andhra Pradesh, India whose objective was to increase the level of output (about 30%) with decrease in the investment done prior to the farming. It was equipped with the alert messages provided to the farmers regarding the most suitable dates for cropping, land preparation, and usage of fertilizer using this app which works and gives required results by taking the images uploaded by the farmers from the user end. In another study, the development of machine learning technology along with integrated computer vision applications by Blue River Technologies aimed to optimize the herbicide and pest control. This technology helps to distinguish between the affected and normal parts of the plant. The see and spray project of Arkansas, USA, using this technology, got reduction in the required amount of expenses for weedicides per acre of land. In a different study done on the crop harvesting, it was found that the time taken by AI-based robots in tomato farms in Japan, is lesser than the time taken by the human.",
